# SmartLeagues

DO NOT USE, DEPLOY, OR FORK. 
I am aware security flaws, lack of gas optimization, and not fully robust test script.

GOALS FOR PROJECT
First go at Solidity and Javascript.
Goal was to get comfortable programming in Solidity and Javascript, learn Truffle, writing test scripts, and writing a front end that interacts with smart contracts.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Wanted to make a non-trivial escrow type contract for golf league managers to create and monitor leagues.
Handling buy in, score keeping, and payouts.

FUTURE UPGRADES
Need to rework the contracts to downsize the contract size.
Make the base structure more modular to easily add league and round type behaviors such as singles round, doubles league, doubles round game modes without repetitive implementation of very similar functions.
